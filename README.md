# Pokedex

Pokemon is a very popular cartoon among kids and adults. Pokemon fans can visit my pokedex website to find the identity card of any pokemon they would like.
Each card displays a picture of the pokemon, its id number, name, and type.

Coding Achievements:

- used aysnc/await/fetch to get the data from the pokemon API
- utilised multiple array methods to access the API data
- created HTML elements in javascript and injected API data into the DOM using multiple methods
- built a colors variable equals to an object with key value pairs and mapped through the pokemon types to correspond each type to a different background color
